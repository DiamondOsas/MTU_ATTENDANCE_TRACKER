  5. The "Student History" Card (Granular)
  Concept: "Print out a document" for a specific person.

   * How: Add a search bar. User types a Matric Number.
   * Logic: The system scans the entire date range. The output document is a "Report     Card" for that specific student:
       * Student: John Doe
       * Total Absent: 4
       * Dates: 12/01 (Service), 14/01 (Bible Study)...
   * Pros: Great for disciplinary actions or specific inquiries.
   * Cons: Only processes one student at a time, not a batch report.
