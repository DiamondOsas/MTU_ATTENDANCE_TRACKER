So i have decided put the functions in record_func.py and the gui in record_gui.py 
and then in absentees.py and attendace.py make it to invoke functions custom to the Type
so it shhould pass arguments to open the gui and thereby naming all the places that is to be called "Absenteees" or "Attendeees"
and making the it to inovke the funtion form the gui using target  then the tpr of mark that will be used ot sort
