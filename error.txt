Based on your current codebase structure in internal/records, here are 5 ways to  
  implement a "Frequency/Count Report" feature. I have ordered them from easiest to 
  integrate to most robust.

  1. The "Summary Export" Option (Quickest)
  Concept: Keep the current GUI exactly as it is. Just modify the Export button     
  logic. When the user clicks "Export All", ask them (or check a box) if they want a  "Detailed Daily Log" (current behavior) or a "Frequency Summary".

   * How: In PrintRecordsWindow, modify export_data.
   * Logic: instead of saving separate files for each date, create a single       
     DataFrame where you iterate through the range, count occurrences per student,
     and save one Excel file with columns: Surname | Firstname | Matric No | Total
     Count.
   * Pros: Minimal UI changes.
   * Cons: You can't see the counts on screen before exporting.

  2. The "View Mode" Toggle (Interactive)
  Concept: Add a toggle in PrintRecordsWindow to switch the display between
  "Chronological" (Date by Date) and "Aggregate" (Ranked by Count).

   * How: Add a ctk.CTkSegmentedButton with values ["Daily View", "Frequency View"].   * Logic:
       * Daily View: Your current loop (Date -> Activity -> List of Names).
       * Frequency View: Loop through the range silently, aggregate counts into a   
         dictionary {MatricNo: Count}, then display a sorted list: "1. John Doe     
         (MAT123) - Missed 5 times".
   * Pros: User sees the data immediately.
   * Cons: Slightly more complex display logic in one file.

  3. The "Threshold Filter" (Action-Oriented)
  Concept: Instead of just listing everyone's count, allow the user to filter: "Show  me everyone who missed more than [ X ] times."

   * How: Add a small input box Threshold: [ 3 ] next to the "Show Records" button.
   * Logic: When processing the specific date range, filter out any student whose  
     calculated count is less than the threshold.
   * Pros: Extremely useful for finding "at-risk" students or those eligible for   
     rewards (perfect attendance).
   * Cons: Hides data for people below the threshold (unless set to 0).

  4. Dedicated "Statistics" Module (Clean Architecture)
  Concept: Create a new folder internal/records/statistics with its own    
  StatisticsWindow.

   * How: Decouple this from the "Records" view. The "Records" view is for      
     editing/checking specific days. The "Statistics" view is for analysis.     
   * Logic: This window would handle selecting a file, a date range, and then   
     generating a pure numbers report (Table of students vs. Counts) without the
     "Daily View" overhead.
   * Pros: Keeps code clean. Allows for future features like charts or graphs.  
   * Cons: Requires creating new files/classes.

  5. The "Student History" Card (Granular)
  Concept: "Print out a document" for a specific person.

   * How: Add a search bar. User types a Matric Number.
   * Logic: The system scans the entire date range. The output document is a "Report     Card" for that specific student:
       * Student: John Doe
       * Total Absent: 4
       * Dates: 12/01 (Service), 14/01 (Bible Study)...
   * Pros: Great for disciplinary actions or specific inquiries.
   * Cons: Only processes one student at a time, not a batch report.

  Recommended Implementation Plan
  I suggest combining #1 and #2.
   1. Add a "View Mode" toggle to the existing window so users can see the counts on      screen.
   2. Update the Export function to respect that mode (exporting the summary list if      "Frequency View" is active).
